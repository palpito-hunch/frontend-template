# Product Overview

This is an AI code generation standards repository. It provides coding standards, validation rules, and templates that both Claude and Kiro IDE use to generate consistent, high-quality code.

## Purpose

Provides a single source of truth for AI-assisted code generation rules. Projects copy the `.kiro/` directory and `CLAUDE.md` to inherit these standards.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive coding standards for TypeScript projects
- Library-specific best practices (Prisma, Next.js, Zod)
- Machine-readable validation rules for AI code generation
- Feature specification templates for spec-driven development
- Priority framework for resolving conflicting standards
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and domain glossary
